ðŸŽ“ Student Registration Form â€“ Built in MS Access
ðŸ“… Project Date: August 2025
ðŸ”§ Tools Used: Microsoft Access (Forms, Tables, and VBA)

Iâ€™m excited to share a hands-on project I recently built: a fully functional Student Registration Form designed in Microsoft Access. This form streamlines the student onboarding process with a user-friendly interface and essential fields like:

âœ… Registration Number (AutoNumber)
âœ… Personal Details â€“ Name, DOB, Gender, City
âœ… Academic Info â€“ Qualification, Year of Passout
âœ… Course Details â€“ Course Name, Payment Mode, Referral Source
âœ… Contact Info â€“ Phone, Email
âœ… Easy navigation buttons for New Record and Save Record

ðŸ“Œ Built-in dropdowns, form validation, and relational tables ensure data integrity and efficient data entry. This form can be directly connected to reports and queries for further processing.
